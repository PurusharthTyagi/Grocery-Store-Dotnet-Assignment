----------------{Exit Test}---------------------
Backend - MVc ,Entity Framework, web Api
Frontend - Angular
Database - SQL Server

1) First run the backend by extracting TestBack file
    a) TestBack contains ("GroceryAPI.sln") run it in Visual Studio
    b) Rebuild 
    c) Run " update-database " command in package manager console
    d) In SQL server a database will be created of name "grocery"
    e) We have used seeding technique for the admin so ,
               - you can simply signUp for a user
		- Admin Credentials = {
                                       Email : - Mentor@nagarro.com
		                       Password : - AdminRights
                                       }  

        
2) Then run the frontend by extracting TestFront 
    a) run GroceryUI in VScode
    b) make sure you are in the location where angular is intialized ("which you will be by default")
    c) then use the command "ng serve -o"
